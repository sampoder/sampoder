👋 G'day! My name is Sam. I'm an Australian who grew up in Singapore; nowadays, I live in California. I enjoy making things (mostly involving code), playing soccer, running hackathons and adventuring on public transit.

At school, I'm a TA for [CS70](https://www.eecs70.org/) (Berkeley's discrete mathematics and probability theory class). I've spent the past two years working on 🏦 HCB — an [open source](https://github.com/hackclub/hcb) fiscal sponsorship platform built using Ruby on Rails. 

And, this summer, I'm living in 🗽 New York City and interning at [Ambrook](https://ambrook.com/about)! I'll be building financial tools that enable farms, ranches, and other industrial operations to become more sustainable and profitable.

You can email me at [sampoder@berkeley.edu](mailto:sampoder@berkeley.edu). Also, my pronouns are `he/him/his`.
