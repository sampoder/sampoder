👋 G'day! My name is Sam. I'm an Australian who grew up in Singapore; nowadays, I live in California. I enjoy making things (mostly involving code), playing soccer, running hackathons and learning about random pieces of trivia.

Away from school I spend my time working with friends on 🏦 HCB — a fiscal sponsorship platform built using Ruby on Rails. We give people the tools they need do incredible things in the real world: [hackclub.com/fiscal-sponsorship](https://hackclub.com/fiscal-sponsorship).

You can email me at [sampoder@berkeley.edu](mailto:sampoder@berkeley.edu). Also, my pronouns are `he/him/his`.
